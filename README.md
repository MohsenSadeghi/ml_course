# Machine Learning and its Application to Protien Engineering

In this repository, you find the resources of my teaching module.

Feel free to contact me at mohsen.sadeghi@fu-berlin.de if you have questions or comments.

The ```notebooks```  folder contains the Jupyter notebooks pertaining to the examples being discussed in the course.
You can open each notebook here in **github**, or use the button at the top of the notebook to be directed to **Google Colaboratory**, which opens an identical colab notebook. If you are signed in with a Google account, you can run the colab notebook in your browser.

The data used by the machine learning codes are freely available at https://ftp.mi.fu-berlin.de/pub/cmb-data/mohsen_data. But I have included code in the notebooks that will download this data upon need (also works with Google colab).

The ```presentation```  folder contains the material used during the presentation of the course (the slides).

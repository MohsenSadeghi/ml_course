# Machine Learning and its Application to Protien Engineering

In this repository, you find the resources of my teaching module.

The folder ```notebooks```  contains the Jupyter notebooks pertaining to the examples being discussed in the course.
You can open each notebook here in **github**, or use the button at the top of the notebook to be directed to **Google Colaboratory**, which opens an identical colab notebook. If you are signed in with a Google account, you can run the colab notebook in your browser.

The data used by the machine learning codes are freely available at https://ftp.mi.fu-berlin.de/pub/cmb-data/mohsen_data.
